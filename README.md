# Polaritonic_TT
This repository provides the code for the Polaritonic chemistry with TT-TFD manuscript (arxiv:2404.09852). In particular, it reproduces the population dynamics of Fig. 3 with \omega_p=600meV. Note that a TT-rank of 35 needs to be used to obtain fully converged result in the manuscript.

# Dependencies
This package requires the following:

python
matplotlib
numpy
scipy
gfortran

# Instructions
To run the code, execute the following commands:
python Polaritonic_TT.py
